## Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This Movie Recommender System, categorized under semantic analysis, offers personalized movie suggestions using vectorization and cosine similarity techniques.

## Objectives
- Utilize semantic analysis through vectorization (TF-IDF) to convert movie descriptions into numerical representations.
- Calculate cosine similarity to measure semantic alignment between user preferences and movies.
- Deliver tailored movie recommendations for an enhanced user experience.

## Methods and Techniques
1. *Data:* Gathered movie dataset with titles, genres, and descriptions.
2. *Vectorization:* Employed TF-IDF to create numerical vectors from movie descriptions.
3. *User Profiling:* Generated user profiles from viewing history and preferences.
4. *Cosine Similarity:* Calculated similarity between user profiles and movie vectors.
5. *Recommendations:* Generated personalized movie recommendations.

## Implementation
- Developed in Python using libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK for NLP.

## Evaluation
- Assessed system performance with metrics like MAE and RMSE.
- User feedback collected through surveys and A/B testing.

## Results
- Improved recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction with personalized, semantically analyzed movie suggestions.

## Challenges and Future Work
- Addressed sparse data and diversity in recommendations.
- Future work includes adding collaborative filtering, deploying as a web/mobile app, and algorithm refinement.

## Conclusion
This Movie Recommender System, grounded in semantic analysis, enhances the user experience with personalized movie recommendations. It advances content-based recommendation systems by focusing on semantic alignment between user preferences and movie features.
